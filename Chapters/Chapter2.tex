\subsection{Adversarial Attacks }
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%(2)

In general \emph{Adversarial Attacks} against models
are small perturbations from natural data which significantly perturb
model output. 
Szegedy et al. \cite{Szegedy2013} realized that the same computational tools
used to train ANNs could be used to generate attacks that would
confuse them. Their approach was to define a loss function
relating the output of the ANN for a given initial image to a target adversarial 
output plus the $L^2$-norm of the input and use backpropagation to
compute gradients -- not on the weights of the neural network, but on
just the input layer to the network. The solution to this optimization
problem, efficiently approximated by a gradient-based optimizer, would
be a slightly perturbed natural input with a highly perturbed
output. Their experimental results are striking:\\

\subsubsection{Common Datasets}

The Dataset used above is known as ImageNet -- a large set of labeled images varying in size originally compiled for the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC). This dataset and its many subsets has become a standard for image classification and feature identification experiments. In the experiments that follow, ImageNet will be featured alongside the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset which is a database of hand written digits often used to develop image processing and character recognition systems. This dataset is much lower resolution than ImageNet and is therefore experiments run much more quickly on it and require less complex input/output.  

\subsubsection{L-BFGS minimizing distortion}\label{lbfgs}

Szegedy et al. took advantage of the tools they had on hand for training neural networks to set up a box-constrained optimization problem whose approximated solution generates these targeted misclassifications. 


Let $f : \R^m \to \{1,...,k\}$ be a classifier and assume $f$ has an associated continuous loss function denoted by loss$_f : \R^m \times \{1,...,k\} \to \R^+$ and $l$ a target adversarial . \\
\textbf{ Minimize} $\Norm{r}_2$ subject to:
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item $f(x + r) = l$
\item $x + r \in [0,1]^m$
\end{enumerate}

The solution is approximated with L-BFGS (see Appendix \ref{appa}) as implemented in Pytorch or Keras. This technique yields examples that are close to their original counterparts in the $L^2$ sense.  \\

%Find the minimum $c > 0$ for which the minimizer $r$ of the following satisfies $f(x+r) = l$\\

%minimize $c|r| + $loss$_f(x+r,l)$ subject to $x + r \in [0,1]^m$.

\paragraph{L-BFGS: Mnist}
The following examples are prepared by implementing the above technique via pytorch on images from the Mnist dataset with FC200-200-10, a neural network with 2 hidden layers with 200 nodes each:
\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{Original images on the left, Perturbation is in the middle, Adversarial Image (total of Original with Perturbation) is on the right. Column 1 shows an original 8 being perturbed to adversarial classes 0, 2, and 4. Column 2 shows adversarial classes 1, 3, and 5}
\end{figure}
Borrowing a metric from Szegedy et al to compare the magnitude of these distortions, we will define
\begin{definition}{Distortion is the $L^2$ norm of the difference between an original image and a perturbed image, divided by the square root of the number of pixels in the image: }
\[\sqrt{\dfrac{\sum_i \hat (x_i - x_i)^2}{n}}\]
\end{definition}
Distortion is $L^2$ magnitude normalized by the square-root of the number of dimensions so that values can be compared for modeling problems with differing numbers of dimensions. 

The 900 examples generated for the network above had an average distortion of 0.089 with the following distribution of distortions, given in figure 3.

\begin{figure}[H]
\label{lbfgsh}

\caption{A histogram of the distortion measured for each of 900 adversarial examples generated using L-BFGS against the FC-200-200-10 network on Mnist. Mean distortion is 0.089.}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{L-BFGS: ImageNet}
\label{lbfgs-s}
We also tried to replicate \cite{Szegedy2013}'s results on ImageNet. Attacking VGG16, a well known model from the ILSVRC-2014 competition \cite{simonyan2014very}, on ImageNet images with the same technique generates the examples in figure 4: 

\begin{figure}[H]
\label{lbfgsis}

%The average distortion was 0.01 distributed as seen in figure \ref{lbfgsi}.

\caption{A histogram of the distortion measured for each of 112 adversarial examples generated using L-BFGS against the VGG16 network on ImageNet images with mean distortion 0.0107}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)} 

  We also implemented a single step attack process uses the gradient of the loss function $L$ with respect to the image to find the adversarial perturbation \cite{goodfellow_explaining_2014}. for given $\e$, the modified image $\hat x$ is computed as
\begin{equation}
\hat{x} = x + \epsilon \text{sign} (\nabla L (P_w(x),x))
\end{equation}

This method is simpler and much faster to compute than the L-BFGS technique described above, but produces adversarial examples less reliably and with generally larger distortion. Performance was similar but inferior to the Iterative Gradient Sign Method summarized below.  
%\[\hat x = x + \e \sign(\Delta \ell(F(x'_m),x'_m))\]

\paragraph{Iterative Gradient Sign Method (IGSM)}
\label{igsm-s}
In \cite{kurakin_adversarial_2016}
  an iterative application of FGSM was proposed. After each
  iteration, the image is clipped to a $\e L_\infty$ neighborhood of the original. Let $x'_0 = x$, then after $m$ iterations, the adversarial image obtained is:
\begin{equation}
x_{m+1}' = \text{Clip}_{x,\epsilon} \Bigl\{x_m' + \alpha \times \text{sign}(\nabla \ell (F(x'_m),x'_m))  \Bigr\} 
\label{igsm}
\end{equation}
This method is faster than L-BFGS and more reliable than FGSM but still produces examples with greater distortion than L-BFGS. 
%  \[x'_{m + 1} = \text{Clip}_{x,\e} \{ x'_m + \alpha \times
%  \sign(\Delta \ell(F(x'_m),x'_m))\]

%The attacks contained in figure ~\ref{fgsmhip} were generated with IGSM against VGG16


\subsubsection{Other Attacks}
The following attack techniques are also prevalent in the literature but have not been replicated in these experiments. 

\paragraph{Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack (JSMA)} Another attack noted by  \cite{papernot_limitations_2015}
  estimates the \emph{saliency map}, a rating for each of the input features (e.g. each pixel) on how influential it is for causing the model to predict a particular class with respect to the model output \cite{wiyatno2018saliency}. This attack modifies the pixels that are most salient. This is a targeted attack, and saliency is designed to find the pixel which increases the classifier's output for the target class while tending to decrease the output for other classes.

\paragraph{Deep Fool (DFool)} A technique proposed by \cite{moosavi-dezfooli_deepfool:_2015}
  to generate an un-targeted iterative attack. 
This method approximates the classifier as a linear decision boundary and then finds the smallest perturbation needed to cross that boundary.
This attack minimizes $L_2$ norm with respect to  to the original image.

\paragraph{Carlini \& Wagner (C\&W)} In \cite{carlini_towards_2016}
  an adversarial attack is proposed which updates the loss function such that it jointly minimizes $L_p$ and a custom differentiable loss function based on un-normalized outputs of the classifier (\textit{logits}). 
Let $Z_k$ denote the logits of a model for a given class $k$, and $\kappa$ a margin parameter. Then C\&W tries to minimize:
\begin{equation}
|| x - \hat{x} ||_p + c* max\left(Z_k(\hat{x}_y) - max\{Z_k(\hat{x}) : k \neq y\},-\kappa\right)
\end{equation}

\section{Introduction}


Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and their variants are core to the success of modern machine learning \cite{prakash2018}, and have dominated competitions in image processing, optical character recognition, object detection, video classification, natural language processing, and many other fields ~\cite{SCHMIDHUBER201585}. Yet such classifiers are notoriously susceptible to manipulation via adversarial examples \cite{Szegedy2013}. Adversarial examples occur when natural data are close enough to the decision boundary that they can be imperceptibly perturbed to another class. Adversarial examples are not just a peculiarity, but seem to occur for most, if not all, DNN classifiers. For example, ~\cite{shafahi2018are} used isoperimetric inequalities on high dimensional spheres and hypercubes to conclude that there is a reasonably high probability that a correctly classified data point has a nearby adversarial example. ~\cite{ilyas2019adversarial} showed that adversarial examples can arise from features that are good for classification but not robust to perturbation.

%There are now a wide variety of attacks which produce adversarial examples and defenses which try to detect them. \todo{[DG]: not sure this is necessary. [K]: This paragraph is incomplete. Do you think there shouldn't be such a paragraph at all? [DG]: Not sure it is needed. If so, it maybe should probably come right at the beginning before the shafahi/are adversarial examples inevitable.}

There have been many attempts to identify adversarial examples using properties of the decision boundary. ~\cite{Fawzi2018empirical} found that decision boundaries tend to have highly curved regions, and these regions tend to favor negative curvature, indicating that regions that define classes are highly nonconvex. These were found for a variety of DNNs and classification tasks. 
%They also suggest exploiting this curvature discrepancy to identify when a data point is a natural image and when it is adversarial. 
A related idea is that adversarial examples often arise within cones, outside of which images are classified in the original class, as observed by ~\cite{roth19aodds}. Many theoretical models of adversarial examples, for instance the dimple model developed by ~\cite{shamir2021}, have high curvature and/or sharp corners as an essential piece of why adversarial examples can exists very close to natural examples.



{\bf Contributions.} We propose two concepts, $(\gamma,\sigma)$-stability and $\gamma$-persistence.  Both are defined with reference to a classifier and a given point (which can be either a natural or adversarial image, for example). The proposed notion of stability is more nuanced than simply measuring distance to the decision boundary, and is also capable of elucidating information about the curvature of the nearby decision boundary.  Persistence is a statistic that measures how far away from a point one can go via Gaussian sampling and still consistently find points with the same classification. One advantage of this statistic is that it is easily estimated by sending a Monte Carlo sampling about the point through the classifier.

Our methods try to exploit similar structure, but is done in a different way by doing Gaussian sampling about a point instead of approximating curvatures of decision boundaries. Since the results in \cite{Fawzi2018empirical} are based on computing an approximation of a curvature function, they depend on an assumption of being close to the decision boundary. Our method does not need that assumption since the Gaussian sampling is not related to functions but instead based on measures. Curvatures have a close connection to tube formulas \cite{morvan}, which is related to the uniform measure on balls. These measures may not be well-behaved in high dimensions, which is one of the main reasons we choose to instead consider Gaussian measures, which factorize nicely in high dimensions.
% \todo{[DG]: These need to be expanded and placed here or elsewhere, but are extremely important.}

% \section{Background}\todo{[DG]: probably remove this whole section}
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%(2)

% We primarily consider adversarial examples for classifiers.  To wit, let $X$ be a set of possible data and let $L$ be a set of labels. We will consider classifier as a map $\CC: X \to L$. In general $X$ may be much larger than the actual space from which our data are drawn. If the data actually come from a submanifold of $X$, we call this the \emph{data submanifold}. The data submanifold may not be a strict submanifold, and we often do not know the shape or even dimension of it.

% %Data is drawn from a distribution $\mu$ on $X$ that is usually not known. The overarching goal of classification is to produce a classifier such that $\CC$ is as good as possible on the support of $\mu$. 
% %We define $X_N \subseteq X$ to be the support of $\mu$ and call it the set of \emph{natural data}. 
% %Usually our classification problem is the following: given a set of i.i.d. samples $\Sigma \sim \mu$
% %, where we consider $\Sigma \subseteq X_N$, 
% %and a classifier $\CC_\Sigma$ on $\Sigma$, find a classifier $\CC$ on $X$ such that $\CC$ lies in some class of ``good functions'' in such a way that it is relatively good at interpolating and/or extrapolating $\CC_\Sigma$. In particular, we hope that $\CC$ is as accurate as possible on the support of $\mu$, which we call the ``natural data.'' \todo{[K]: To a ML audience, it seems to me a bit overkill to describe the idea of statistical learning. Also, this isn't how they would likely describe it, so it could put people off. DG: Agreed, we can probably eliminate this.}
% The classifier $\CC$ partitions $X$ into classes, each of which is defined as $\CC^{-1}(\ell)$ for some $\ell \in L$. Points on the boundaries of these classes do not have a clear choice of label, and the points in $X$ on the boundaries of the classes make up the \emph{decision boundary} for $\CC$.

% %To build up to a definition for stability, we develop definitions and terms to refer to adversarial examples without relying on subjective characteristics like human vision. 
% %Let $X$ denote a set of possible data and $L$ denote a set of labels that distinguish the different classes. 
% We are now ready to define adversarial examples.%We now define adversarial examples.

% \begin{definition} \label{def:advers}
% Let $d$ be a metric on $X$, let $x\in X$ have label $\ell\in L$, and let $\CC:X\to L$ be a classifier.  We say that $x$ admits an \emph{$(\e,d)$--adversarial example} to $\CC$ if there exists $\hat x \in X$ such that $d(x,\hat x) < \e$ and $\CC(\hat x) \neq \ell$.
% %Consider a point $x \in X$ with corresponding class $\ell \in C$ and a classifier $\CC: X \to C$. We say that $x$ admits an \emph{$(\e,d)-$adversarial example} on $\CC$ if there exists a point $\hat x$ such that $d(x,\hat x) < \e$ and $\CC(\hat x) \neq c$. 
% \end{definition}
% One typically considers Definition \ref{def:advers} in the context of small $\e$. 
% %Often consideration is made of when such a misclassification is a result of an intentionally act by an adversary. 
% There are various methods of producing adversarial examples which are discussed later. In some cases, the adversarial label is explicitly targeted:
% \begin{definition}
% Let $d$ be a metric on $X$, let $x\in X$ have label $\ell\in L$, and let $\CC:X\to L$ be a classifier.  Let $\varepsilon>0$ and $\ell_t\neq \ell$ be fixed but arbitrary. We say that $x$ admits an \emph{$(\varepsilon,d,\ell_t)$--targeted adversarial example} to $\mathcal{C}$ if there exists $\hat{x}\in X$ such that $d(x,\hat{x})<\varepsilon$ and $\CC(\hat{x})=\ell_t$.
% %Consider a point $x \in X$ with corresponding class $\ell \in C$ and a classifier $\CC: X \to C$. We say that $x$ admits an \emph{$(\e,d,\ell_t)-$targeted adversarial example} on $\CC$ if there exists a point $\hat x$ such that $d(x,\hat x) < \e$ and $\CC(\hat x) = \ell_t$. 
% \end{definition}

% These definitions rely on a metric $d$, emphasizing the reliance on the choice of distance to understand notions of closeness. From here on, we will assume that $(X,d)$ is a Euclidean vector space with $d$ being the Euclidean metric. This will allow for the use of standard Gaussian distributions as well.\todo{[K]: The part about Gaussians here is unclear. [DG]: What I mean here is that one needs a distance metric to define Gaussian distributions. Maybe it is not relevant here?}


% Note that there is no restriction on whether adversarial examples come from the set of natural examples, and typically we will assume that they do not so that we can draw a contrast. 
% %We define adversarial examples, sometimes called adversarial attacks, against classifiers
% %to be small perturbations from natural data that significantly change the classifier output. See Definition \ref{def:advers} for a formal definition.
% %Szegedy et al. 
% ~\cite{Szegedy2013} realized that the same computational tools
% used to train DNN classifiers could be used to generate attacks that would
% confuse them. Their approach was to define a loss function
% relating the output of the DNN for a given initial image to a target adversarial

\section{Motivation and related work}
Our work is intended to shed light on the existence and prevalence of adversarial examples to DNN classifiers. It is closely related to other attempts to characterize robustness to adversarial perturbations, and here we give a detailed comparison.


%In the Sections \ref{sec:stab} and \ref{sec:experiments}, we will investigate stability of both natural data and adversarial examples in an attempt to understand how these different sets lie in the domain of the classifier. Understanding these geometries is a challenge for several reasons. For one, the data lies in a high dimensional space and thus the decision boundaries between classes are complicated submanifolds. Distances in high dimensional spaces are difficult to work with and do not always yield useful information. In particular, uniform distributions on balls in high dimensions often result in surprising results ~\cite{aggsurprising}. Instead, we consider high dimensional Gaussian distributions, using the variance as an alternative to distance. ~\cite{roth19aodds} and ~\cite{hosseini2019odds} take a similar approach, considering Gaussian noise perturbations of $\varepsilon$ times a vector with normal distribution $N(0,I)$. We describe their work below but note that they do not take advantage of using the variance to probe distributions which are more or less concentrated near their means.


%DG: moved to introduction Adversarial examples occur when natural data are close enough to the decision boundary that they can be imperceptibly perturbed to another class. Adversarial examples are not just a peculiarity, but seem to occur for most if not all DNN classifiers. ~\cite{shafahi2018are} use isoperimetric inequalities on high dimensional spheres and hypercubes to conclude that there is a reasonably high probability that a correctly classified data point has a nearby adversarial example. ~\cite{ilyas2019adversarial} show that adversarial examples can arise from features that are good for classification but not robust to perturbation.

%{\bf Properties of the decision boundary.}
%data manifold, curvature of the decision boundary

{\bf Distance-based robustness.}
%Since we expect adversarial examples to exist, an important question is whether we can define a classifier to be robust to perturbations that might shift a natural example to an adversarial example. 
A typical approach to robustness of a classifier is to consider distances from the data manifold to the decision boundary.  ~\cite{Khoury2018} define a classifier to be robust if the class of each point in the data manifold is contained in a sufficiently large ball that is entirely contained in the same class. The larger the balls, the more robust the classifier. It is then shown that if training sets are sufficiently dense in relation to the reach of the decision axis, the classifier will be robust in the sense that it classifies nearby points correctly. In practice, we do not know that the data is so well-positioned, and it is quite possible, especially in high dimensions, that the reach is extremely small, as evidenced by results on the prevalence of adversarial examples, e.g., \cite{shafahi2018are}.

~\cite{tsipras2018robustness} investigated robustness in terms of how small perturbations affect the the average loss of a classifier. They define standard accuracy of a classifier in terms of how often it classifies correctly, and robust accuracy in terms of how often an adversarially perturbed example classifies correctly. It was shown that sometimes accuracy of a classifier can result in poor robust accuracy. ~\cite{gilmer2018adversarial} use the expected distance to the nearest different class (when drawing a data point from the data distribution) to capture robustness, and then show that an accurate classifier can result in a small distance to the nearest different class in high dimensions when the data is drawn from concentric spheres. 

{\bf Adversarial detection via sampling.}
While adversarial examples often occur, they still may be rare in the sense that most perturbations do not produce adversarial examples. ~\cite{yu2019new} used the observation that adversarial examples are both rare and close to the decision boundary to detect adversarial examples. They take a potential data point and look to see if nearby data points are classified differently than the original data point after only a few iterations of a gradient descent algorithm. If this is true, the data point is likely natural and if not, it is likely adversarial. We will draw on a similar idea by considering nearby points drawn from Gaussian distributions of varying standard deviations in order to better quantify this observation of rarity. In general, the results of ~\cite{yu2019new} indicate that considering samples of nearby points, which approximate the computation of integrals, is likely to be more successful than methods that consider only distance to the decision boundary.

%The goal would be to either develop a classifier robust to adversarial examples or to identify adversarial examples as opposed to natural data.

%DG: Moved to introduction. There have been many attempts to identify adversarial examples using properties of the decision boundary. ~\cite{Fawzi2018empirical} found that decision boundaries tend to have highly curved regions, and these regions tend to favor negative curvature, indicating that regions that define classes are highly nonconvex. These were found for a variety of DNNs and classification tasks. They also suggest exploiting this curvature discrepancy to identify when a data point is a natural image and when it is adversarial. It is also suggested that adversairal examples often arise within a cone, outside of which images are classified in the original class, as observed by ~\cite{roth19aodds} and as part of the dimple model theorized by ~\cite{shamir2021}.



~\cite{roth19aodds} proposed a statistical method to identify adversarial examples from natural data. Their main idea was to consider how the last layer in the neural network (the logit layer) would behave on small perturbations of a natural example. %, i.e., on $x+\varepsilon n$ where $x$ is a natural example, $\varepsilon>0$ is small, and $n \sim N(0,I)$.  
This is then compared to the behavior of a potential adversarial example. If it differs by a predetermined threshold, the example is flagged as adversarial. Successfully flagging adversarial examples in this way works best when adversarial examples tend to perturb toward the original class from which the adversarial example was perturbed. However, this is not always the case.
It was shown by ~\cite{hosseini2019odds} that it is possible to produce adversarial examples, for instance using a logit mimicry attack, that instead of perturbing an adversarial example toward the true class, actually perturb to some other background class. In fact, we will see in Section \ref{sec:mnist} that the emergence of a background class, which was observed as well by ~\cite{roth19aodds}, is quite common. 

%DG: Mostly moved to introduction. ~\cite{roth19aodds} propose a statistical method to identify adversarial examples from natural data. Their main idea is to consider how the last layer in the neural network (the logit layer) would behave on a natural example with a small Gaussian perturbation, i.e., on $x+\varepsilon n$ where $x$ is a natural example, $\varepsilon>0$ is small, and $n \sim N(0,I)$.  This is then compared to the behavior of a potential adversarial example. If it differs by a predetermined threshold, the example is flagged as adversarial. Successfully flagging adversarial examples in this way is predicated on the hypothesis that adversarial examples tend to perturb toward the true class that they have been perturbed from. It is shown by ~\cite{hosseini2019odds} that it is possible to produce adversarial examples, for instance using a logit mimicry attack, that instead of perturbing an adversarial example toward the true class, actually perturb to some other background class. 
%In fact, we will see in Section \ref{sec:mnist} that the emergence of a background class, which was observed as well by ~\cite{roth19aodds}, is quite common. 

%This behavior will be observed in the case of classifiers of the MNIST digits dataset.

Whereas ~\cite{roth19aodds} consider adding various types of noise to a given point and ~\cite{hosseini2019odds} consider small Gaussian perturbations of $x$ sampled from $N(x,\varepsilon^2 I)$ for small $\varepsilon$, %\todo{[K]: Should we go ahead and just be clear here and say $N(x,\varepsilon^2 I)$?} %noise perturbations of $\varepsilon$ times a vector with normal distribution $N(0,I)$ with a small selection of choices for $\varepsilon.$
we specifically focus on %Our choice to consider varying standard deviations is quite similar to considering varying choices of $\varepsilon$ in the latter, but our focus is on 
tuning the standard deviation parameter to determine a statistic describing how a given data point is placed within its class. The $\gamma$-persistence then gives a measurement similar to distance to the boundary but that is drawn from sampling instead of distance. The sampling allows for a better description of the local geometry of the class and decision boundary, as we will see in Section \ref{sec:stab}. Our statistic is based on the fraction of a Gaussian sampling of the neighborhood of a point which receives the same classification; this is different from that of ~\cite{roth19aodds}, which is the expected difference of the output of the logit layer of the original data point and the output of the logit layer for perturbed data points.  Additionally, while their statistics are defined pairwise with reference to pre-chosen original and candidate classes, ours is not.


%The focus of this particular paper is choosing that length apprWe instead consider perturbations of the form $N(0,\sigma^2 I)$ and vary $\sigma$. Each of these methods will perturbations with the same average length if $\varepsilon=\sigma$, but the latter will provide a greater spread of values for the length of the perturbations.

%The main reason\todo{[DG]: Yes, this needs to be moved. [K]: Yeah, but they are using Gaussians too, so I don't understand this comment about uniform distributions..} is that high dimensional Gaussian distributions are generally better behaved than uniform distributions on balls in high dimensions ~\cite{aggsurprising}. In addition, instead of just testing for various choices of the parameter, we find the parameter value for which the expectation of having a different result is above a certain threshold.

% ~\cite{yu2019new} observed that adversarial examples are a problem both because many are close to the decision boundary and they are rare. They use these almost contradictory observations to detect adversarial examples by taking a potential datapoint and looking to see if there are contra-classfied points (i.e., points classified different than the original datapoint) nearby that can be reached by only a few iterations of a gradient descent algorithm. If this is true, the datapoint is likely natural and if not, it is likely adversarial. The algorithm uses cutoff points based on previous understanding of the data. 



%Each of these works is predicated on understanding stability of natural and adversarial examples under Gaussian perturbations of the data. In this study, we look more closely at how such perturbations change classification. In the sequel, we will give a definition that is agnostic of choice of classifier, though we focus on different types of Neural Network based classifiers.

{\bf Summary.}
 In Sections \ref{sec:stab} and \ref{sec:experiments}, we will investigate stability of both natural data and adversarial examples by considering sampling from Gaussian distributions centered at a data point with varying standard deviations. Using the standard deviation as a parameter, we are able to derive a statistic for each point that captures how entrenched it is in its class in a way that is less restrictive than the robustness described by ~\cite{Khoury2018}, takes into account the rareness of adversarial examples described by ~\cite{yu2019new}, builds on the idea of sampling described by ~\cite{roth19aodds} and ~\cite{hosseini2019odds}, and represent curvatures in a sense related to ~\cite{Fawzi2018empirical}. 
 %The main contribution is the development of a precise notion of stability, called $(\gamma, \sigma)$-stability, and a statistic, called $\gamma$-persistence, that represent each of these notions in a quantitative, clear way. The methods use sampling of Gaussians, which is generally quite easy compared to other measures in high dimensions.  \todo{[DG]: we maybe want to add the reference \cite{creschi2019} to discuss using dimension reduction/t-SNE to capture manifold property of data and \cite{Lee2018ASU} with a method to detect out of manifold data for adversarial attacks} 


\section{Stability and Persistence} \label{sec:stab}
In this section we define a notion of stability of classification of a point under a given classification model. In the following, $X$ represents the ambient space the data is drawn from (typically $\RR^n$) even if the data lives on a submanifold of $X$, and $L$ is a set of labels (often $\{1,\dots,\ell\}$).  Note that points $x\in X$ can be natural or adversarial points.%The following definition complements the definition for adversarial examples by providing a criteria for the local stability of the classifier about a point, which could be an actual test point or an adversarial example: 

\begin{definition}
Let $\CC:X\to L$ be a classifier, $x \in X$, $\gamma\in(0,1)$, and $\sigma>0$. We say $x$ is \emph{$(\gamma,\sigma)$-stable} with respect to $\CC$ if $\mathbb{P}[\CC(x')=\CC(x)] \geq \gamma$ for $x' \sim \rho = N(x, \sigma^2 I)$; i.e. $x'$ is drawn from a Gaussian with variance $\sigma^2$ and mean $x$.
\end{definition}

In the common setting when $X=\RR^n$, we have
\[\mathbb{P}[\CC(x')=\CC(x)] = \int_{\RR^n} \mathbbm{1}_{\CC^{-1}(\CC(x))} (x') d\rho (x') = \rho(\CC^{-1}\CC(x)).\]
Note here that $\CC^{-1}$ denotes preimage. %In the case of images drawn from $\RR^n$, we can write this integral precisely as
One could substitute various probability measures $\rho$ above with mean $x$ and variance $\sigma^2$ to obtain different measures of stability corresponding to different ways of sampling the neighborhood of a point.  Another natural choice would be sampling the uniform measure on balls of changing radius. Based on the concentration of measure for both of these families of measures (see Appendix \ref{sec:concentration}), we do not anticipate significant qualitative differences in these two approaches. We propose Gaussian sampling because it is also a product measure, which makes it easier to sample and simplifies some other calculations below.

For the Gaussian measure, the probability above may be written more concretely as
\begin{equation}\label{EQN:Gaussian}
\frac{1}{\left(\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma\right)^{n}} \int_{\RR^n} \mathbbm{1}_{\CC^{-1}(\CC(x))} (x')e^{-\frac{\norm{x - x'}^2}{2\sigma^2}} dx'.
\end{equation}
In this work, we will conduct experiments in which we estimate this stability for fixed $(\gamma,\sigma)$ pairs via a Monte Carlo sampling, in which case the integral \eqref{EQN:Gaussian} is approximated by taking $N$ i.i.d. samples $x_k \sim \rho$ and computing
\[
    \frac{\norm{x_k : \CC(x_k) = \CC(x)}}{N}.
\]
Note that this quantity converges to the integral \eqref{EQN:Gaussian} as $N\to\infty$ by the Law of Large Numbers.

The ability to adjust the quantity $\gamma$ is important because it is much weaker than a notion of stability that requires a ball that stays away from the decision boundary as in \cite{Khoury2018}. By choosing $\gamma$ closer to $1$, we can require the samples to be more within the same class, and by adjusting $\gamma$ to be smaller we can allow more overlap.

We also propose a related statistic, \emph{persistence}, by fixing a particular $\gamma$ and adjusting $\sigma$. For any $x\in X$ not on the decision boundary, for any choice of $0<\gamma<1$ there exists a $\sigma_\gamma$ small enough such that if $\sigma < \sigma_\gamma$ then $x$ is $(\gamma,\sigma)$-stable. We can now take the largest such $\sigma_\gamma$ to define persistence.

%In our experiments, $\gamma$ is fixed and $\sigma$ is adjusted to determine the largest $\sigma$ for which an image is $(\gamma,\sigma)$-stable.  We define this to be persistence as follows.


\begin{definition}
    Let $\CC:X\to L$ be a classifier, $x \in X$, and $\gamma\in(0,1)$. Let $\sigma_\gamma^*$ be the maximum $\sigma_\gamma$ such that $x$ is $(\gamma, \sigma)$-stable with respect to $\CC$ for all $\sigma<\sigma_\gamma$. We say that $x$ has \emph{$\gamma$-persistence} $\sigma_\gamma^*$.
\end{definition}

The $\gamma$-persistence quantity $\sigma_\gamma^*$ measures the stability of the neighborhood of a given $x$ with respect to the output classification. Small persistence indicates that the classifier is unstable in a small neighborhood of $x$, whereas large persistence indicates stability of the classifier in a small neighborhood of $x$. In the later experiments, we have generally taken $\gamma = 0.7$. This choice is arbitrary and chosen to fit the problems considered here. In our experiments, we did not see significant change in results with small changes in the choice of $\gamma$.

In order to better understand the notion of $\gamma$-persistence, consider a decision boundary that is the boundary of a conical wedge domain $W^n_k \subset \RR^n$, where $0<k\leq n$, defined by 
\[
    W^n_k = \{(x_1, \ldots, x_n) \in \RR^n : x_1 \geq 0, \ldots, x_k \geq 0\}.
\]
One can consider this as a Cartesian product of a half space and a positive orthant (see Figure \ref{fig:orthants} for the three possibilities if $n=3$). The boundary of $W^n_k$ consists of parts of hyperplanes (in fact, $W^m_\ell$ for $m\leq n$ and $\ell \leq k$). It is clear that for larger $k$, there is more curvature (this can be made precise using the notion of curvature measures via tube formulas as in \cite{morvan}). We now explore $\gamma$-persistence for data points inside wedge domains, which will serve as a local model for adversarial examples within their adversarial classes.
%For example, in three dimensions, we can consider decision boundaries shaped like a plane, two planes intersecting orthogonally and meeting along a line, or three planes intersecting orthogonally and all meeting at a point. For a point that is equidistant to the planes, we can compute the persistence exactly as follows.

%Recall the formula (\ref{EQN:Gaussian}).
\begin{proposition} \label{prop:orthants}
    If the point $x \in W^n_k$ such that $W^n_k$ describes the class of $x$ and $x$ is a distance $d$ from each sheet of the boundary of $W^n_k$, then the integral (\ref{EQN:Gaussian}) is equal to
\[
    \left( \frac{1}{2}\left(  1+\operatorname{erf}\left(  \frac{d}{\sqrt
    {2}\sigma}\right)  \right) \right)^k,
\]
    where $\operatorname{erf}(z)=\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_0^z e^{-y^2}dy$ is the error function.
    It follows that the $\gamma$-persistence of $x$ is
\[
    \sigma_\gamma^* = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}\operatorname{erf}^{-1} \left( 2 \gamma^{1/k} -1\right)}.
\]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
First, consider a decision boundary consisting of a hyperplane in $\RR^n$
and suppose that the point $x$ is a distance $d$ from that decision boundary. If we rotate the situation so that the plane is orthogonal to the $x_{n}$-axis, we can compute the integral \eqref{EQN:Gaussian} exactly:
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{\left(\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma\right)^{n}}& \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \cdots \left( \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left( \int_{-\infty}^{x_n+d} e^{-\frac{\left(  x'_n-x_n\right)  ^{2}}{2\sigma^2}
}dx'_n \right)e^{-\frac{\left(  x'_{n-1}-x_{n-1}\right)  ^{2}}{2\sigma^2}} dx'_{n-1}\right) \cdots e^{-\frac{\left(  x'_{1}-x_{1}\right)  ^{2}}{2\sigma^2}} dx'_{1}
\\
%&=\sqrt{2\sigma}\int_{-\infty}^{d/\sqrt{2\sigma}}e^{-y^{2}}dy\\
&=\frac{1}{2}\left(  1+\operatorname{erf}\left(  \frac{d}{\sqrt
{2}\sigma}\right)  \right).
\end{align*}
Since the Gaussian factorizes, a similar calculation shows that for the point $x$ of distance $d$ away from the sheets of $W_k^n$, the integral \eqref{EQN:Gaussian} is the $k$-th power of the expression above. The fact that this is equal to $\mathbb{P}[\CC(x')=\CC(x)]$ for $x' \sim \rho = N(x, \sigma^2 I)$ completes the proof.
%a point $x$ that is $d$ distance away from $k$ planes that make up a convex cone, the integral is the $k$-th power of the expression above.
% \[
%     \left( \frac{1}{2}\left(  1+\operatorname{erf}\left(  \frac{d}{\sqrt
% {2}\sigma}\right)  \right) \right)^k.
% \]
\end{proof}


Note that these results are independent of the ambient dimension ($n$) and only depend on the number of hyperplanes ($k$) making up the cone piece. This fact is related to a similar observation about the Gaussian isoperimetric inequality (e.g., \cite{ledoux1996isoperimetry}).

\end{figure}

Observe from Proposition \ref{prop:orthants} that if the distance $d$ to the decision boundary is fixed, then the more planes that make up the decision boundary, the smaller the persistence will be.  For illustration, Figure \ref{FIG:Persistence} shows the $0.7$-persistence for the point $x$ in Proposition \ref{prop:orthants} as a function of the number of planes $k$ with $d=1$. Observe that when $k=1$, the $0.7$-persistence is approximately $1.91$ despite the distance from the decision boundary being equal to $1$; this is due to the fact that one must sample from a Gaussian with larger variance to have 30\% of the samples be on the other side of a single plane decision boundary.  Additionally, as $k$, and hence curvature of the boundary, increases, the persistence value becomes less than the distance to the nearest decision boundary, which remains $1$. This illustrates that persistence carries more information regarding the landscape of the decision boundary about $x$ than merely the distance to the boundary.  Note also that if the initial point is outside the cone, then the persistence will be significantly larger. This demonstrates how, even if we consider points equally close to the decision boundary, the persistence can distinguish between being in a location that is inside a cone and outside a cone, as well as how sharp the boundary of those cones may be. The existence of such cones or curved decision boundaries is both seen experimentally ~\cite{Fawzi2018empirical,roth19aodds} and theorized ~\cite{shamir2021}. It is expected that adversarial examples lie inside the cone, as modeled by the wedge domains, and the natural examples lie outside the cone or wedge domain.

%It follows that if we fix the distance $d$ to the decision boundary, the more planes making up the decision boundary, the smaller the persistence will be. For instance, in the case of $d=1$ and a single hyperplane decision boundary, the $0.7$-persistence is approximately $1.91$, whereas a two hyperplane decision boundary has $0.7$-persistence of approximately $1.02$ and a three hyperplane decision boundary has $0.7$-persistence of approximately $0.82$. Note that if the initial point is outside the cone, then the persistence will be significantly larger. This demonstrates how, even if we consider points equally close to the decision boundary, the persistence can distinguish between being in a location that is inside a cone and outside a cone, as well as how sharp the boundary of those cones may be. The existence of such cones or curved decision boundaries is both seen experimentally ~\cite{Fawzi2018empirical,roth19aodds} and theorized ~\cite{shamir2021}.

\end{figure}


In our experiments, we numerically estimate $\gamma$-persistence via a bisection algorithm that we term the Bracketing Algorithm (Appendix \ref{sec:bracketing}).  Briefly, the algorithm first chooses search space bounds $\sigma_{\min}$ and $\sigma_{\max}$ such that $x$ is  $(\gamma,\sigma_{\min})$-stable but is not $(\gamma,\sigma_{\max})$-stable with respect to $\CC$, and then proceeds to evaluate stability by bisection until an approximation of $\sigma_\gamma^*$ is obtained.


%This is accomplished by a bracketing procedure: we first expand the search space bounds $\sigma_{\min}$ and $\sigma_{\max}$ so that the average number of samples at these bounds are below (respectively above) $\gamma$.  This search space is then sequentially bisected to identify a $\sigma$ corresponding with $\gamma$ (the full algorithm is presented in the Appendix).

%We can compute approximate the $\gamma$-persistence using a bisection algorithm we call the Bracketing Algorithm. The Bracketing Algorithm is given as Algorithm \ref{bracketing} in Appendix \ref{sec:bracketing}.

\section{Experiments} \label{sec:experiments}

%???Did we try Carlini-Wagner method? -- B2 not yet, working on it for Imnet

% B2 -- here's what we have ready to go

In this section we investigate the stability and persistence behavior of natural and adversarial examples for MNIST ~\cite{MNIST} and ImageNet ~\cite{ILSVRC15} using a variety of different classifiers. For each set of image samples generated for a particular dataset, model, and attack protocol, we study $(\gamma,\sigma)$-stability and $\gamma$-persistence of both natural and adversarial images, and also compute persistence along trajectories from natural to adversarial images. In general, we use $\gamma = 0.7$, and note that the observed behavior does not change significantly for small changes in $\gamma$. While most of the adversarial attacks considered here have a clear target class, the measurement of persistence does not require considering a particular candidate class. These experiments were performed using PyTorch on an HPC configured with 28 CPUs, 192gb of memory, and 1 nvidia p100 GPU per node. Total compute time needed to generate the results presented was approximately 300 Teraflop/s-days. 




% Adversarial examples are generated using Iterative Gradient Sign Method (IGSM) ~\cite{kurakin_adversarial_2016}, which is an iterative version of the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) \cite{goodfellow_explaining_2014}, as well as the more primitive Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) optimization algorithm ~\cite{liu1989limited}. 

% The neighborhoods around datapoints and adversarial examples are sampled using Gaussians with varying standard deviation $\sigma$, and Algorithm \ref{bracketing} is used to approximate $\gamma$-persistence corresponding to $\gamma=0.7$. The resultant $0.7$-persistence $\sigma_{.7}^*$ statistically identifies examples as being $(0.7,\sigma_{.7}^*)$-stable, meaning that 70\% of the samples drawn from a Gaussian with standard deviation $\sigma$ are classified the same as the original class by the model. 

% The first test of the ideas behind $(\gamma, \sigma)$-stability is to consider what happens to Gaussian samples as the standard deviation is increased from zero. To this end, for each choice of $\sigma$ ??Where?? we took 1000 samples around the original image or adversarial image and plotted the count of how many were classified with each label. These results are seen in Figures ???? %Algorithm \ref{bracketing} is used to approximate $\gamma$-persistence corresponding to $\gamma=0.7$. The resultant $0.7$-persistence $\sigma$ statistically identifies examples as being $(0.7,\sigma)$-stable, meaning that 70\% of the samples drawn from a Gaussian with standard deviation $\sigma$ are classified the same as the original class by the model. 
% In order to understand the impact of model complexity on $(\gamma, \sigma)$-stability of adversarial examples, we considered the framework of ~\cite{Szegedy2013}, looking at a variety of networks of differing complexities, including both fully-connected and convolutional neural networks.


\subsection{MNIST Experiments}

%The MNIST dataset consists of 28 by 28 pixels, so it can naturally be considered as a data set on a 784 dimensional vector space. The size of this data makes it ideal for initial testing. 
Since MNIST is relatively small compared to ImageNet, we trained several classifiers with various architectures and complexities and implemented the adversarial attacks directly. Adversarial examples were generated against each of these models using Iterative Gradient Sign Method (IGSM ~\cite{kurakin_adversarial_2016}) and Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS ~\cite{liu1989limited}).


 

\subsubsection{Investigation of $(\gamma, \sigma)$-stability on MNIST}\label{sec:mnist}

We begin with a fully connected ReLU network with layers of size 784, 100, 20, and 10 and small regularization $\lambda = 10^{-7}$ which is trained on the standard MNIST training set. We then start with a randomly selected MNIST test image $x_1$ from the \texttt{1}'s class and generate adversarial examples $x_0,x_2,\dots,x_9$ using IGSM for each target class other than \texttt{1}. The neighborhoods around each $x_i$ are examined by generating 1000 i.i.d. samples from $N(x_i,\sigma^2I)$ for each of 100 equally spaced standard deviations $\sigma\in(0,1.6)$. Figure \ref{fgsmo} shows the results of the Gaussian perturbations of a natural example $x_1$ of the class labeled \texttt{1} and the results of Gaussian perturbations of the adversarial example $x_0$ targeted at the class labeled \texttt{0}. We provide other examples of $x_2,\ldots,x_9$ in the supplementary materials. Note that the original image is very stable under perturbation, while the adversarial image is not.

\subsubsection{Persistence of adversarial examples for MNIST}

% For adversarial examples, we are particularly interested in comparing the classification counts around each example relative to the distortion ($\|x\|_2/\sqrt{n}$) introduced to generate the example. We then compute $0.7$-persistence for a variety of models and samples and summarize these results.

To study persistence of adversarial examples on MNIST, we take the same network architecture as in the previous subsection and randomly select 200 MNIST images. For each image, we used IGSM to generate 9 adversarial examples (one for each target class) yielding a total of 1800 adversarial examples. In addition, we randomly sampled 1800 natural MNIST images. For each of the 3600 images, we computed $0.7$-persistence; the results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:IGSMpersistenceMNIST}. One sees that $0.7$-persistence of adversarial examples tends to be significantly smaller than that of natural examples for this classifier, indicating that they are generally less stable than natural images. We will see subsequently that this behavior is typical.

%and generate adversarial examples using IGSM for each of 200 randomly selected MNIST images to each possible target other than the original class (9 total targets) for a total of 1800 adversarial examples. 
 %The images were processed using a bisection algorithm (Algorithm \ref{bracketing} in the supplementary materials) to compute $0.7$-persistence. The results are aggregated in Figure \ref{fig:IGSMpersistenceMNIST}.

%\subsection{Effects of network complexity on persistence}
%{Neighborhood sampling of L-BFGS adversarial examples for MNIST}

Next, we investigate the relationship of network complexity and $(\gamma,\sigma)$-stability by revisiting the now classic work of ~\cite{Szegedy2013} on adversarial examples. 
%In these experiments, we used L-BFGS technique from \cite{Szegedy2013} to prepare adversarial examples. The same network architectures and examples were subjected to $0.7$-persistence analysis to determine the correspondence of stability with network accuracy and average distortion. In this case we will loosely define complexity as the effective number of parameters of a network and distortion is the $\ell^2$ norm divided by square root of the dimension $n$. 
%[??DG??: We need to define complexity and add it to the table]
%\subsubsection{Re-examining Szegedy Results with sampling}
%
Table \ref{table1} recreates and adds on to part of \cite[Table 1]{Szegedy2013} in which networks of differing complexity are trained and attacked using L-BFGS. The table contains new columns showing the average $0.7$-persistence for both natural and adversarial examples for each network, as well as the average distortion for the adversarial examples. The distortion is the $\ell^2$-norm divided by square root of the dimension $n$. The first networks listed are of the form FC10-k, and are fully connected single layer ReLU networks that map each input vector $x \in \RR^{784}$ to an output vector $y \in \RR^{10}$ with a regularization added to the objective function of the form $\lambda\Norm{w}_2/N$, where $\lambda = 10^{-k}$ and $N$ is the number of parameters in the weight vector $w$ defining the network. The higher values of $\lambda$ indicate more regularization.  
%added as regularization to the objective function during training. FC10-2 is the same except with $\lambda = 10^{-2}$ and FC10-0 has $\lambda=1$ (a very large coefficient for regularization). 
FC100-100-10 and FC200-200-10 are networks with 2 hidden layers (with 100 and 200 nodes, respectively) with regularization added for each layer of perceptrons with the $\lambda$ for each layer equal to $10^{-5}, 10^{-5}$, and  $10^{-6}$. Training for these networks was conducted with a fixed number of epochs (typically 21). For the bottom half of Table \ref{table1}, we also considered networks with four convolutional layers plus a max-pooling layer connected by ReLU to a fully connected hidden layer with increasing numbers of channels denoted as as ``C-Ch,'' where C reflects that this is a CNN and Ch denotes the number of channels. A more detailed description of these networks can be found in Appendix \ref{appendix:CNNs}.

The main observation from Table \ref{table1} is that for higher complexity networks,
adversarial examples tend to have smaller persistence than natural examples. Histograms reflecting these observations can be found in the supplemental material. %This can be seen as well in Figure \ref{fig:FC200-200-10}, which shows the $0.7$-persistence for natural and adversarial examples for the network FC200-200-10. 
Another notable takeaway is that for models with fewer effective parameters, the attack distortion necessary to generate a successful attack is so great that the resulting image is often more stable than a natural image under that model, as seen particularly in the FC10 networks. Once there are sufficiently many parameters available in the neural network, we found that both the average distortion of the adversarial examples and the average $0.7$-persistence of the adversarial examples tended to be smaller. This observation is consistent with the idea that networks with more parameters are more likely to exhibit decision boundaries with more curvature.

\subsection{Results on ImageNet}

% For ImageNet, various pretrained networks (vgg16, alexnet, resnet18, densenet161, and squeezenet) were downloaded using torchvision and were attacked with a variety of attack methods %(PGD, FGSM, APGD, CW, ??) 
% using the torchattacks package \cite{kim2021torchattacks}. In all of our tests, we begin with a subset of validation images from the given dataset and generate a collection of adversarial attacks based on those images for each combination of model and attack protocol. 

For ImageNet ~\cite{Imagenet-old}, we used pre-trained ImageNet classification models, including alexnet \cite{alexnet} and vgg16 \cite{simonyan2014very}.
%, resnet18, squeezenet, and densenet161 \cite{}
We then generated attacks based on the ILSVRC 2015 ~\cite{ILSVRC15} validation images for each of these networks using a variety of modern attack protocols, including Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM ~\cite{goodfellow_explaining_2014}), Momentum Iterative FGSM (MIFGSM ~\cite{dongMIFGSM}), Basic Iterative Method (BIM ~\cite{kurakin_adversarial_2016}), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD ~\cite{madry_towards_2017}), Randomized FGSM (R+FGSM ~\cite{tramer2018ensemble}), and Carlini-Wagner (CW ~\cite{carliniwagner}). These were all generated using the TorchAttacks \cite{kim2021torchattacks} toolset.
%We first directly examine neighborhood classification counts as with MNIST and observe a similar dichotomy between original and attacked images. 

\subsubsection{Investigation of $(\gamma, \sigma)$-stability on ImageNet}

In this section, we show the results of Gaussian neighborhood sampling in ImageNet. Figures \ref{fig:imagenet_adv} and \ref{fig:persistent_interpimage} arise from vgg16 and adversarial examples created with BIM; results for other networks and attack strategies are similar, with additional figures in the supplementary material. Figure \ref{fig:imagenet_adv} (left) begins with an image $x$ with label \texttt{goldfinch}. For each equally spaced $\sigma\in(0,2)$, 100 i.i.d. samples were drawn from the Gaussian distribution $N(x,\sigma^2I)$, and the counts of the vgg16 classification for each label are shown. In Figure \ref{fig:imagenet_adv} (right), we see the same plot, but for an adversarial example targeted at the class \texttt{indigo\_bunting}, which is another type of bird, using the BIM attack protocol. %There are similar results with other attack protocols, as described in the supplementary materials.

The key observation in Figure \ref{fig:imagenet_adv} is that the frequency of the class of the adversarial example (\texttt{indigo\_bunting}, shown in red) falls off much quicker than the class for the natural example (\texttt{goldfinch}, shown in black). In this particular example, the original class appears again after the adversarial class becomes less prevalent, but only for a short period of $\sigma$, after which other classes begin to dominate. In some examples the original class does not dominate at all after the decline of the adversarial class. The adversarial class almost never dominates for a long period of $\sigma$.

\subsubsection{Persistence of adversarial examples on ImageNet}


Figure \ref{fig:persistent_interpimage} shows a plot of the $0.7$-persistence along the straight-line path between a natural example and adversarial example as parametrized between $0$ and $1$. It can be seen that the dropoff of persistence occurs precisely around the decision boundary. This indicates some sort of curvature favoring the class of the natural example, since otherwise the persistence would be roughly the same as the decision boundary is crossed.

An aggregation of persistence for many randomly selected images from the \texttt{goldfinch} class in the validation set for Imagenet are presented in Table \ref{TAB:PersistenceAlexVGG}. For each image of a \texttt{goldfinch} and for each network of alexnet and vgg16, attacks were prepared to a variety of 28 randomly selected targets using a BIM, MIFGSM, PGD, FGSM, R+FGSM, and CW attack strategies. The successful attacks were aggregated and their $0.7$-persistences were computed using the Bracketing Algorithm along with the $0.7$-persistences of the original images from which each attack was generated. Each attack strategy had a slightly different mixture of which source image and attack target combinations resulted in successful attacks. The overall rates for each are listed, as well as particular results on the most successful attack strategies in our experiments, BIM, MIFGSM, and PGD. The results indicate that adversarial images generated for these networks (alexnet and vgg16) using these attacks were less persistent, and hence less stable, than natural images for the same models.

\section{Conclusion}

%In general, our intuition that adversarial examples are less stable than than natural examples is supported by the results in Table \ref{table1}. 


%The more complex neural networks tended to support less stable adversarial examples, but ones that are closer to the natural examples. 


In order to better understand the observed tendency for points near natural data to be classified similarly and points near
adversarial examples to be classified differently, we defined a notion of $(\gamma,\sigma)$-stability which is easily estimated by Monte Carlo sampling. For any data point $x$, we then define the $\gamma$-persistence to to be the smallest $\sigma_\gamma$ such that the probability of similarly classified data is at least $\gamma$ when sampling from Gaussian distributions with mean $x$ and standard deviation less than $\sigma_\gamma$. The persistence value can be quickly estimated by a Bracketing Algorithm. These two measures were considered with regard to both the MNIST and ImageNet datasets and with respect to a variety of classifiers and adversarial attacks. We found that adversarial examples were much less stable than natural examples in that the $0.7$-persistence for natural data was usually significantly larger than the $0.7$-persistence for adversarial examples. We also saw that the dropoff of the persistence tends to happen precisely near the decision boundary. Each of these observations is strong evidence toward the hypothesis that adversarial examples arise inside cones or high curvature regions in the adversarial class, whereas natural images lie outside such regions.

We also found that often the most likely class for perturbations of an adversarial examples is a class other than the class of the original natural example used to generate the adversarial example; instead, some other background class is favored. In addition, we found that some adversarial examples may be more stable than others, and a more detailed probing using the concept of $(\gamma,\sigma)$-stability and the $\gamma$-persistence statistic may be able to help with a more nuanced understanding of the geometry and curvature of the decision boundary. Although not pursued here, the observations and statistics used in this paper could potentially be used to develop methods to detect adversarial examples as in \cite{crecchi2019,frosst2018,hosseini2019odds,Lee2018ASU,qin2020,roth19aodds} and others. As with other methods of detection, this may be susceptible to adaptive attacks as discussed by ~\cite{tramer2020adaptive}. 



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% end of what is "written"
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% We first revisit attacks and metrics from ~\cite{Szegedy2013} so that we can compare our stability metric with the properties observed in that original paper. ~\cite{tramer2020adaptive} present methodology and approach necessary to perform adaptive attacks against defended neural networks. These methods provide a framework for our work, which picks a subset of these networks to study in more depth.
% We then further explore the effect of DNN complexity by training, attacking, and analyzing a collection of CNNs of increasing complexity and a collection of CNNs with diminishingly narrower auto-encoders. 

% % B2 -- here's what's coming down the pipeline: 
% Using pre-trained Imagenet classification models (vgg16, alexnet, resnet18, squeezenet, densenet, and inception v3), we generate attacks based on imagenet  ILSVRC 2015 validation images for each of each of these networks \cite{??}. We then generate stability statistics for the original images and adversarial images. 

% % B2 -- here are some things on my todo list but as yet unprioritized
% % option 1 : implement more attacks
% We used the method of ~\cite{carliniwagner} and other typical attacks to generate attacks against each of the MNIST networks mentioned above and also the pretrained Imagenet networks. We generated stability analysis for these attacks as well. 

% % option 2 : generate adaptive attacks against our stability metric when used as a detector
% Working from the Adaptive Adversarial attack framework described by ~\cite{madry_towards_2017}, we wrote a detector based on the stability analysis, attacked this new augmented network (both MNIST and Imagenet). We present the accuracy of our detector model on adversarial images and our rate of detection. In addition, we have performed stability analysis on the resulting attack images and present that as well. 

% % Option 3 : analyze stability of images along the optimization trajectory used to generate the adversarial images 
% [DG: This is not completed, right?] We analyzed stability of images at all steps along the optimization used to generate adversarial attacks to gain insight about how that optimization path corresponds with the decision boundary -- both distortion and persistence are presented along this optimization (plot x-axis is distortion -- plot y-axis is persistence, trajectory is plotted using arrows and dots to show the order of the optimization steps.) (Example images are shown along this path in the adjacent plot)




% We look first at finding adversarial examples of fully connected DNN classifier for MNIST. We then consider adversarial examples of fully connected DNN classifiers for ImageNet. Finally, we explore the influence of the complexity of the DNN by considering both fully connected and convolutional DNNs on MNIST of varying levels of complexity.


% In the following experiments, adversarial examples are generated using Iterative Gradient Sign Method (IGSM) ~\cite{kurakin_adversarial_2016}, which is an iterative version of the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) \cite{goodfellow_explaining_2014}, as well as the more primitive Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS)

% The neighborhoods around datapoints and adversarial examples are sampled using Gaussians with varying standard deviation $\sigma$, and Algorithm \ref{bracketing} is used to approximate $\gamma$-persistence corresponding to $\gamma=0.7$. The resultant $0.7$-persistence $\sigma$ statistically identifies examples as being $(0.7,\sigma)$-stable, meaning that 70\% of the samples drawn from a Gaussian with standard deviation $\sigma$ are classified the same as the original class by the model.

% \subsubsection{$(\gamma, \sigma)$-stability for adversarial examples on ImageNet}
% [??DG?? This section needs picture similar to the previous section] Similar to the above analysis for MNIST, an image $x$ was selected with original class "Rose-Hip," and then an perturbation $x_a$ was found using IGSM so that the sum $x + x_a$ is an adversarial example with class "Baseball." Then 50 Gaussian samples were generated for each of 1000 evenly spaced standard deviation $\sigma$ values. These samples were added to $x$ and $x+x_a$. Figure  \ref{fig:IGSMpersistenceImageNet} shows classifications are colored via a heatmap.

% \begin{figure}[p]

% \end{figure}

% The $0.7$-persistence of 50 natural examples (DG: of rose hip?) are shown in Figure \ref{fig:IGSMpersistenceImageNet}. In addition, the $0.7$-persistence of the adversarial example is denoted with a red dot.

% \label{imnetfgsmsamp}
% \end{figure}

% Much like the above case for MNIST, IGSM examples generated on ImageNet were much less $(\gamma,\sigma)$-stable than natural images. DG: Explain:?? 98\% of adversarial images could be distinguished by their $(\gamma,\sigma)$-stability. It should be noted that due to computational intensity of processing ImageNet samples, this dataset is significantly smaller than that used for the MNIST experiments. 

% \subsection{Effects of network complexity on persistence}
% %{Neighborhood sampling of L-BFGS adversarial examples for MNIST}

% As a further study into the relationship of network complexity with $(\gamma,\sigma)$-stability, we revisit the now classic work of \cite{Szegedy2013} on adversarial examples. In these experiments, we used L-BFGS technique from \cite{Szegedy2013} to prepare adversarial examples. The same networks and examples were be subjected to $0.7$-persistence analysis to determine any correspondence of stability with network accuracy and average distortion. 
% [??DG??: We need to define complexity and add it to the table]

% We also consider complexity of this type on convolutional DNNs, consisting of a composition of convolutional layers, followed by a truncation step that drops most of the results from the last convolutional layer, resulting in a low width layer, which is followed by some fully connected layers. 
%In our experiments, 
%a typical network is denoted ``C-Ch-$k$,'' where C reflects that this is a convolutional DNN, Ch denotes the number of channels and $k$ denotes the width of the smallest level, for instance, ``C-128-2''. 
%The ``C'' indicates my convolutional framework. The 128 indicates the number of channels per convolutional layer. The 4714 indicates the number of outputs which are \emph{discarded} from the final layer. In this case, 128 channels in my convolutional structure yields 4716 total output dimensions from the final convolutional layer. Dropping 4714 of these leaves $k = 2$ values which will be passed into the fully connected component of the network. In this way, we can look at more complicated DNNs in the following two dimensions ???
% The network has the form:

% %\vspace{.4cm}

% \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
% \hline
%      Layer & Type & Channels & Kernel & Stride & Output Shape \\
% \hline

%      1 & Conv & 128 & $(5,5)$& $(1,1)$& $(128, 24, 24)$\\
%      2 & Conv & 128 & $(5,5)$& $(1,1)$& $(128, 20, 20)$\\
%      3 & Conv & 128 & $(5,5)$& $(1,1)$& $(128, 16, 16)$\\
%      4 & Conv & 128 & $(5,5)$& $(1,1)$& $(128, 12, 12)$\\
%      5 & Max Pool & 128 & $(2, 2)$ & $(2, 2)$& $(128, 6, 6)$ \\

%      8 & FC & $(256, 10)$ & NA & NA & 10 \\
%      \hline
% \end{tabular}

% \noindent Where $k$ is a number of desired output parameters from the convolutional component. 
% [DG: What changes if the number of channels changes? Can we give a general form.]
% We denote such a network as ``C-Ch-$k$,'' where C reflects that this is a convolutional DNN, Ch denotes the number of channels and $k$ denotes the width of the smallest level, for instance, ``C-128-2''.

% %\subsubsection{Re-examining Szegedy Results with sampling}

% Table \ref{table1} is a recreation of \cite[Table 1]{Szegedy2013} in which networks of differing complexity are trained and attacked using L-BFGS. In addition to recreating the results from \cite{Szegedy2013}, the table contains columns for the average $0.7$-persistence natural and adversarial examples for each network. The networks listed are FC10-4, a fully connected network with no hidden layers that that takes the input vector $x \in \RR^{784}$ to an output vector of $y \in \RR^{10}$ with the $\lambda*\Norm{w}_2/N$ where $\lambda = 10^{-4}$ and $N$ is the number of parameters in $w$) added as regularization to the objective function during training. FC10-2 is the same except with $\lambda = 10^{-2}$ and FC10-0 has $\lambda=1$ (a very large coefficient for regularization). FC100-100-10 and FC200-200-10 are networks with 2 hidden layers with regularization added for each layer of perceptrons with the $\lambda$ for each layer equal to $10^{-5}, 10^{-5}$, and  $10^{-6}$. Training for these networks is conducted with a fixed number of epochs.

%\subsection{CNNs work}

% \section{Conclusion}
% In general, our intuition that adversarial examples are less stable than than natural examples is supported by the results in Table \ref{table1}. 

% The more complex neural networks tended to support less stable adversarial examples, but ones that are closer to the natural examples. 

% Need better discussion and conclusion.
% Key takeaways: 
% 1) Perturbations of adversarial examples do not tend to regress to the original class, but rather to some central class. (Is this still true for Imagenet?)

% Similar to the suggestions of ~\cite{Fawzi2018empirical}, our methods have exploited a notion of curvature based on measures with expanding concentration. A typical example of this method is the tube formulas in integral geometry based on Steiner's early work and greatly generalized to the cases of manifolds, polyhedra, and sets of positive reach \cite{morvan}. These are based on taking uniform measures on balls around the spaces. While this notion is generally considered by taking balls around entire sets, the ideas can also be used to investigate individual points. We consider Gaussian sampling instead because of its ease of use, but the idea that we can change the standard deviations is analogous to changing the radius of uniformly sampled balls. Moreover, concentration inequalities indicate that in high dimensions both cases result in concentration of measure around balls of a radius related to either the standard deviation or radius, respectively (see Section \ref{sec:concentration}). In fact, it may be the case that the differences in the estimates in Proposition \ref{prop:concentration} indicate that Gaussian sampling is, in fact, better than uniform sampling of the ball since the concentration in annuli does not depend on the standard deviation in the case of Gaussian and does depend on radius in the case of uniform.



%, Gaussian measures try to exploit similar structure, but is done in a different way by doing Gaussian sampling about a point instead of approximating curvatures of decision boundaries. Since the results in \cite{Fawzi2018empirical} are based on computing an approximation of a curvature function, they depend on an assumption of being close to the decision boundary. Our method does not need that assumption since the Gaussian sampling is not related to functions but instead based on measures. Curvatures have a close connection to tube formulas \cite{morvan}, which is related to the uniform measure on balls. These measures may not be well-behaved in high dimensions, which is one of the main reasons we choose to instead consider Gaussian measures, which factorize nicely in high dimensions.
%\todo{[DG]: These need to be expanded and placed here or elsewhere, but are extremely important.}



% In these results, we first notice that adversarial attacks generated with IGSM against MNIST are less stable than natural examples from these data sets. This difference is even more pronounced when comparing a adversarial image with other image samples from its target class. This lower stability of adversarial examples is even more pronounced among the attacks prepared via IGSM against VGG16 on ImageNet. Using this technique, we can distinguish adversarial examples prepared by these techniques from natural examples using stability as a test. 

% In the next section of experiments, Table 1 from \cite{Szegedy2013} was reconstructed and augmented with stability measurements. In this table, of the 5 networks trained on the MNIST dataset, the more complicated networks achieved higher accuracy but were defeated by adversarial examples with much less distortion than the simpler adversarial examples. We have added columns indicating the stability of natural and adversarial examples in these models. Adversarial examples generated for more complicated models were much less stable (some less stable than the corresponding natural examples). Adversarial examples generated for the less complicated networks were vastly more stable than natural examples. These results are summarized in the histograms Figure \ref{table1hist1} through \ref{table1hist5}. 

% Type 1: An image whose object measure does not exist under a random
% process $F_w$. This may be recognized in the image space if the
% manifold of measures is observed in the image space. This manifold
% should be of relatively low dimension compared with the dimension of
% the image space, and any images thatvary in directions orthogonal to
% the manifold satisfy Type 1.\\

% \vspace{.3cm}

% e.g. We can consider the image of the
% set of possible handwritten digits under a noiseless
% discretization $A$. It is assumed that the image of the manifold $M$ of
% handwritten digits in $X_O$, $A(M)$ is low dimensional in $X_I$, thus we can 

% \vspace{.3cm}

% consider an $\e$-triangulation of this manifold under $A$ with $\e$
% the resolution of $A$. A type 1 adversarial image will
% be identified as any image that varies more than $\e$ from the
% simplices connecting the triangulation of $A(M)$. 

% Type 2: A perturbation of an image that is indistinguishable under the
% imaging operation (or stochastic imaging process) from an image of an
% admissible object.

% \section{Conclusion/Ongoing Work (incorporate in previous)}
% Through the work of Szegedy et al, it was discovered that more sophisticated DNNs can be fooled with smaller adversarial perturbations than less sophisticated DNNs. This speaks to a trade-off between robustness and accuracy which has continued to be an active area of research \cite{tsipras2018robustness}. In this work, we investigated this further by examining neighborhoods around adversarial and natural examples using sampling and $(\gamma,\sigma)$ stability analysis. The same trade-off was observed and we note that highly sophisticated networks admit adversarial examples with very small distortion which can often be identified by a sampling technique. We conclude that such subtle adversarial examples are often not $(\gamma,\sigma)$ stable. One direction for future work is the combination of this sampling method for analyzing neighborhoods with recent geometric interpretations of neural networks. It is theorized that most imaging datasets are samples of low-dimensional manifolds embedded in much higher dimensional representation spaces \cite{Chang2017}. By sampling neighborhoods, we can identify these manifolds and potentially train neural networks which are better restricted to them.  

% Continuing research will focus on understanding the trade-off between the sophistication (corresponding with accuracy) and the distortion and stability of adversarial examples that can be generated. Further numerical experiments can be focused on exploring the geometric properties of trained DNNs. We have observed in this report that the average distortion of examples which achieve a new adversarial class vary non-linearly among different natural images and different network structures. Investigating $(\gamma,\sigma)$ stability of points on paths between natural and adversarial examples or between different natural images may provide more insight into the geometric interpretation of classification boundaries under DNN models. In addition, there are many more adversarial attack types that can be subjected to this analysis.  We have seen that some robust networks only admit adversarial examples with very significant distortion, while other networks admit examples with much smaller distortion. In particular, there is the outstanding question of extending a definition for adversarial examples which emphasizes the subtlety of such examples. 

% Some recent work on this subject has distinguished "fooling" examples which are images that look nothing like the training \cite{nguyen2015deep}. In their work, Nguyen et al. were able to reliably identify such examples through the use of Generative Adversarial Network discriminators. One interesting experiment would be to test GAN discriminators on adversarial examples with varying distortion. If GANs can distinguish adversarial examples with high distortion, while examples with low distortion are less $(\gamma,\sigma)$ stable than natural images, this may establish a no-free-lunch classification of Adversarial Examples. Such classification would have broad implications across the field of machine-learning.

%[DG: What changes if the number of channels changes? Can we give a general form.]
%We denote such a network as ``C-Ch-$k$,'' where C reflects that this is a convolutional DNN, Ch denotes the number of channels and $k$ denotes the width of the smallest level, for instance, ``C-128-2''.

\section{Additional Figures}
In this section we provide additional figures to demonstrate some of the experiments from the paper.

%\subsection{Figures interpolating between natural and adversarial examples}
%In this section we further investigate what happens on the straight line from a natural example to an adversarial example.

\subsection{Additional figures from MNIST}
In Figure \ref{fig:mnistadv} we begin with an image of a \texttt{1} and generate adversarial examples to the networks described in Section \ref{sec:mnist} via IGSM targeted at each class \texttt{2} through \texttt{9}; plotted are the counts of output classifications by the DNN from samples from Gaussian distributions with increasing standard deviation; this complements Figure \ref{fgsmo} in the main text. Note that the prevalence of the adversarial class falls off quickly in all cases, though the rate is different for different choices of target class.

The adversarial class is shown as a red curve. The natural image class (\texttt{1}) is shown in black. Bottoms show example sample images at different standard deviations.}
    \label{fig:mnistadv}
\end{figure}

We also show histograms corresponding to those in Figure \ref{fig:IGSMpersistenceMNIST} and the networks from Table \ref{table1}.  As before, for each image, we used IGSM to generate 9 adversarial examples (one for each target class) yielding a total of 1800 adversarial examples. In addition, we randomly sampled 1800 natural MNIST images. For each of the 3600 images, we computed $0.7$-persistence. In Figure \ref{fig:FC10}, we see histograms of these persistences for the small fully connected networks with increasing levels of regularization. In each case, the test accuracy is relatively low and distortion relatively high. It should be noted that these high-distortion attacks against models with few effective parameters were inherently very stable -- resulting in most of the ``adversarial'' images in these sets having higher persistence than natural images. This suggests a lack of the sharp conical regions which appear to characterize adversarial examples generated against more complicated models.  In Figure \ref{fig:FC100200} we see the larger fully connected networks from Table \ref{table1} and in Figure \ref{fig:CNNs} we see some of the convolutional neural networks from Table \ref{table1}.

\subsection{Additional figures for ImageNet}

In this section we show some additional figures of Gaussian sampling for ImageNet. In Figure \ref{fig:moreimagenet} we see Gaussian sampling of an example of the class \texttt{indigo\_bunting} and the frequency samplings for adversarial attacks of \texttt{goldfinch} toward \texttt{indigo\_bunting} (classifier: alexnet, attack: PGD) and  toward  \texttt{alligator\_lizard} (classifier: vgg16, attack: PGD). Compare the middle image to Figure \ref{fig:imagenet_adv}, which is a similar adversarial attack but used the vgg16 network classifier and the BIM attack. Results are similar. Also note that in each of the cases in Figure \ref{fig:moreimagenet} the label of the original natural image never becomes the most frequent classification when sampling neighborhoods of the adversarial example.

Bottoms show example sample images at different standard deviations.}

\end{figure}


In Figure \ref{fig:persistencediffgamma}, we have plotted $\gamma$-persistence along a straight line from a natural image to an adversarial image to it with differing values of the parameter $\gamma$. The $\gamma$-persistence in each case seems to change primarily when crossing the decision boundary. Interestingly, while the choice of $\gamma$ does not make too much of a difference in the left subplot, it leads to more varying persistence values in the right subplot of Figure \ref{fig:persistencediffgamma}.  This suggests that one should be careful not to choose too small of a $\gamma$ value, and that persistence does indeed depend on the landscape of the decision boundary described by the classifier.

The classification of each image on the straight line is listed as a number so that it is possible to see the transition from one class to another. The vertical axis is $\gamma$-persistence and the horizontal axis is progress towards the adversarial image.}

\section{Concentration of measures} \label{sec:concentration}

We use Gaussian sampling with varying standard deviation instead of sampling the uniform distributions of balls of varying radius, denoted $U(B_r(0))$ for radius $r$ and center $0$. This is for two reasons. The first is that Gaussian sampling is relatively easy to do. The second is that the concentration phenomenon is different. This can be seen in the following proposition.

\begin{proposition} \label{prop:concentration}
    Suppose $x \sim N(0,\sigma^2 I)$ and $y \sim U(B_r(0))$ where both points come from distributions on $\RR^n$. For $\varepsilon < \sqrt{n}$ and for $\delta < r$ we find the following:
    \begin{align}
        \mathbb{P}\left[\rule{0pt}{15pt} \left| \rule{0pt}{10pt} \Norm{x} - \sigma \sqrt{n} \right| \leq \varepsilon \right] &\geq 1-2e^{-\varepsilon^2/16} \\
        \mathbb{P}\left[\rule{0pt}{15pt} \left| \rule{0pt}{10pt} \Norm{y} - r \right| \leq \delta \right] &\geq 1-e^{-\delta n/r} 
    \end{align}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    This follows from \cite[Theorems 4.7 and 3.7]{wegner2021lecture}, which are the Gaussian Annulus Theorem and the concentration of measure for the unit ball, when taking account of varying the standard deviation $\sigma$ and radius $r$, respectively.
\end{proof}

The implication is that if we fix the dimension and let $\sigma$ vary, the measures will always be concentrated near spheres of radius $\sigma \sqrt{n}$ and $r$, respectively, in a consistent way. In practice, Gaussians seem to have a bit more spread, as indicated in Figure \ref{fig:sampling}, which shows the norms of $100,000$ points sampled from dimension $n=784$ (left, the dimension of MNIST) and $5,000$ points sampled from dimension $n=196,608$ (right, the dimension of ImageNet).

    \label{fig:sampling}
\end{figure}

%Technically, it only shows one side of the bound so maybe it is not true???

%{\color{red}[K]?? So this shows that sampling via Gaussians about a data point is essentially sampling a thin annulus about the sphere of radius $\sigma\sqrt{n}$ centered at $x$.  This may mean that if we look for proportional "volume" from Gaussian sampling, we are really looking more at proportional surface area on the sphere. Could it be that this fraction is better behaved than looking at the volume fraction of the ball?  As a counterpoint though, the argument from ~\cite{shafahi2018are} might indicate that it's not any better behaved.}

%{\color{blue}[DG]: I think the takeaway is that looking at balls and looking at Gaussians is almost the same as long as the radii are not too small and not too large, since in this case it affects the estimates. However, it is a one sided bound so maybe it is just affecting the estimate and not the actual behavior. It probably would be good to do some numerical experiments with Gaussians of high dimension like those in \cite[Figure 1.4]{wegner2021lecture}}

%The following is wrong. I think these two distributions are exactly the same!
%We can also look at the difference between considering perturbations of the form $y=x+ \varepsilon \triangle x$ where $\triangle x \sim N({\bf 0},1)$ and perturbations of the form $z$ where $z \sim N(x, \sigma^2 I)$. If we take $\varepsilon=\sigma$, we find that the expected length of the new vectors is the same, i.e., 
% \begin{align*}
%     \mathbb{E} [|y|] &= x+  \frac{\varepsilon}{(\sqrt{2\pi})^n}\int_{\RR^n} |y|e^{\frac{|y-x|^2}{2}}dy\\
%     &= \frac{\varepsilon}{(\sqrt{2\pi})^n}\int_{\RR^n} |w+x|e^{\frac{|w|^2}{2}}dw
% \end{align*}
% and 
% \begin{align*}
% \mathbb{E} [|z|] &= \frac{1}{(\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma)^n}\int_{\RR^n} |z|e^{\frac{|z-x|^2}{2\sigma^2}}dz \\
% &= \frac{1}{(\sqrt{2\pi})^n}\int_{\RR^n} |\sigma w+x|e^{\frac{|w|^2}{2}}dw.
% \end{align*}

% However, a similar calculation shows that 
% \[
%  \mathbb{E} \left[(|z|-\mathbb{E} [|z|])^2\right] = \sigma \mathbb{E} \left[(|y|-\mathbb{E} [|y|])^2\right]. 
% \]
% DG: I don't think I see this in the sampling...
